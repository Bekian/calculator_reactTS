# React.ts Calculator
- this is my first attempt at a calculator in react with typescript and vite

The main goal is to recreate many (if not, all) of the functions of the windows 11 calculator. Intitially starting with the "Standard" mode and moving on to recreate the other various modes. My other main goal is to get better at a developer and this seems like a perfect opportunity to do so.
